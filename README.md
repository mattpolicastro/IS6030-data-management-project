# IS 6030 Final Project

This project contains my work for the final assignment (Homework #5) in IS 6030 (Data Management) at the University of Cincinnati's Lindner College of Business. This project is meant to demonstrate my abilities in:

* Basic database management and design
* SQL queries
* Basic data analysis and manipulation

For this project, I intend to examine building permit and fire incident data from the City of Cincinnati over the last several years.
